  Fungible is an open source project. Have an idea for a contriubution? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/satoshua/fungible/issues/new). 
</p>

Despite lacking the essential feature of fungibility, Bitcoin's [leading narrative](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c) for some time now, has been [sound money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency). 

But this claim of being equally interchangeable is at the mercy of surveillance, the companies facilitating it, the people behind them, the technologies emerging, and the potential for a 'store of value' to suddenly be rendered value-less.   

What we need is a 'surveillance-free' sound money.
