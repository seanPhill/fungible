Despite lacking the essential feature of fungibility, Bitcoin's [leading narrative](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c) for some time now, has been that of [sound money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency). 

But this claim of being equally interchangeable is at the mercy of surveillance, the companies facilitating it, the people behind them, the invasive technologies emerging, and the potential for a 'store of value' to be suddenly rendered value-less.   

**Fungible** is an open source project investigating the 'Big Brothers' of blockchain. Have an idea for a contriubution? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/satoshua/fungible/issues/new). Want to get updates? You can [subscribe here](https://rssmailer.app/s/fungible) or send our [RSS feed](https://fungible.cc/atom.xml) elsewhere. 

We hope you agree that the world doesn't need yet another monetary Panopticon... What we need is **'surveillance-free' sound money.**
