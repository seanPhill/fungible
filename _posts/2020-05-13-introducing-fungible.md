title: Introducing Fungible
---

**Welcome to Fungible,** an open investigation into the fungibility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the increasing threat of surveillance and its proprietors, and the growing need for a surveillance-free sound money.

Throughout Bitcoin's history, a number of [leading narratives](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c) have occupied the public discourse, but none quite like "censorship-resistant e-gold" and its likeness to [sound money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency). Despite this storyline's dominance, an essential feature of such a supposed hard currency, [fungibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility), has yet to be realised. 

While Satoshi Nakamoto allowed for a level of privacy akin to traditional banking, by [keeping public keys anonymous](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), regulatory forces make it near impossible to keep identities separated from transactions.

Furthermore, the emergence of blockchain surveillance corporations who will stop at nothing short of a digital Panopticon, threatens the beloved 'store of value' thesis. If addresses are blacklisted, is 'censorship-resistance' itself even resistant to censorship? If certain coins are tainted, are those that are not subsequently worth more? Is claiming that `1 BTC = 1 BTC` even reliable?

[Fungible](https://fungible.cc) is dedicated to finding answers to all the questions that spook sound money supporters. We're taking aim at those proponents of surveillance who stand to profit at the expense of the individual. Their expolitative practices don't only jeopardise the right to privacy, they threaten one Bitcoin being interchangeable for another.
